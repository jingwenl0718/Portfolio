    "bio": "I have always been passionate about empowering others to reach their full potential, no matter whether it is through rehab with patients, or using technology to transform our digital life. I had 9 years of first-hand clinical and managerial experience working as a lead occupational therapist and later as the program/product manager of a cross-functional team. While working full-time, I also graduated as one of the top students in my MBA program. Recently I completed a rigorous 14-week, 3-stack software development bootcamp. More than 1000 hours were dedicated to coding, group discussions, and creating 3 full-stack projects either on my own or in a group.",
