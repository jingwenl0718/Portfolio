    "bio": "Whether it is through rehab with patients, or using technology to transform our digital life, I have always been passionate about empowering others to reach their full potential. I had 9+ years of professional experience (with a focus on building user-centered service products/initiatives and customer success) in healthcare, tech and business. While working full-time, I also graduated as one of the top students in my MBA program. After discovering my passion for technology over the past a couple of years, I began teaching myself programming languages (Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS) and eventually completed a rigorous 14-week, 3-stack software development bootcamp with the highest honors in my cohort. Now, I am ready to leverage my diverse skill sets and experiences in healthcare, product management and software development, to build products that can benefit millions of people.",
